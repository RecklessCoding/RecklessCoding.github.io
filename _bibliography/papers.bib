abstract = {This article surveys the Variable Autonomy (VA) robotics literature that considers two contributory elements to Trustworthy AI: transparency and explainability. These elements should play a crucial role when designing and adopting robotic systems, especially in VA where poor or untimely adjustments of the system’s level of autonomy can lead to errors, control conflicts, user frustration, and ultimate disuse of the system. Despite this need, transparency and explainability is, to the best of our knowledge, mostly overlooked in VA robotics literature or is not considered explicitly. In this article, we aim to present and examine the most recent contributions to the VA literature concerning transparency and explainability. In addition, we propose a way of thinking about VA by breaking these two concepts down based on: the mission of the human-robot team; who the stakeholder is; what needs to be made transparent or explained; why they need it; and how it can be achieved. Last, we provide insights and propose ways to move VA research forward. Our goal with this article is to raise awareness and inter-community discussions among the Trustworthy AI and the VA robotics communities.},

   abstract = {Understanding when and why to apply any given eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique is not a straightforward task. There is no single approach that is best suited for a given context. This paper aims to address the challenge of selecting the most appropriate explainer given the context in which an explanation is required. For AI explainability to be effective, explanations and how they are presented needs to be oriented towards the stakeholder receiving the explanation. If—in general—no single explanation technique surpasses the rest, then reasoning over the available methods is required in order to select one that is context-appropriate. Due to the transparency they afford, we propose employing argumentation techniques to reach an agreement over the most suitable explainers from a given set of possible explainers. In this paper, we propose a modular reasoning system consisting of a given mental model of the relevant stakeholder, a reasoner component that solves the argumentation problem generated by a multi-explainer component, and an AI model that is to be explained suitably to the stakeholder of interest. By formalizing supporting premises—and inferences—we can map stakeholder characteristics to those of explanation techniques. This allows us to reason over the techniques and prioritise the best one for the given context, while also offering transparency into the selection decision. },

   abstract = {Several high profile incidents that involve Artificial Intelligence (AI) have captured public attention and increased demand for regulation. Low public trust and attitudes towards AI reinforce the need for concrete policy around its development and use. However, current guidelines and standards rolled out by institutions globally are considered by many as high-level and open to interpretation, making them difficult to put into practice. This paper presents ongoing research in the field of Responsible AI and explores numerous methods of operationalising AI ethics. If AI is to be effectively regulated, it must not be considered as a technology alone—AI is embedded in the fabric of our societies and should thus be treated as a socio-technical system, requiring multi-stakeholder involvement and employment of continuous value-based methods of assessment. When putting guidelines and standards into practice, context is of critical importance. The methods and frameworks presented in this paper emphasise this need and pave the way towards operational AI ethics. },

   abstract = {As robots are introduced to various domains and applications, Human-Robot Teaming (HRT) capabilities are essential. Such capabilities involve teaming with humans in/on/out-the-loop at different levels of abstraction, leveraging the complementing capabilities of humans and robots. This requires robotic systems with the ability to dynamically vary their level or degree of autonomy to collaborate with the human(s) efficiently and overcome various challenging circumstances. Variable Autonomy (VA) is an umbrella term encompassing such research, including but not limited to shared control and shared autonomy, mixed-initiative, adjustable autonomy, and sliding autonomy. This workshop is driven by the timely need to bring together VA-related research and practices that are often disconnected across different communities as the field is relatively young. The workshop's goal is to consolidate research in VA. To this end, and given the complexity and span of Human-Robot systems, this workshop will adopt a holistic trans-disciplinary approach aiming to a) identify and classify related common challenges and opportunities; b) identify the disciplines that need to come together to tackle the challenges; c) identify and define common terminology, approaches, methodologies, benchmarks, and metrics; d) define short- and longterm research goals for the community. To achieve these objectives, this workshop aims to bring together industry stakeholders, researchers from fields under the banner of VA, and specialists from other highly related fields such as human factors and psychology. The workshop will consist of a mix of invited talks, contributed papers, and an interactive discussion panel, toward a shared vision for VA. },

    year = {2021},
    abstract = {This paper is preoccupied with the following question: given a (possibly opaque) learning
	system, how can we understand whether its behaviour adheres to governance constraints?
	The answer can be quite simple: we just need to "ask" the system about it. We propose
	to construct an investigator agent to query a learning agent-- the suspect agent--
	to investigate its adherence to a given ethical policy in the context of an information-seeking
	dialogue, modeled in formal argumentation settings. This formal dialogue framework
	is the main contribution of this paper. Through it, we break down compliance checking
	mechanisms into three modular components, each of which can be tailored to various
	needs in a vast amount of ways: an investigator agent, a suspect agent, and an acceptance
	protocol determining whether the responses of the suspect agent comply with the policy.
	This acceptance protocol presents a fundamentally different approach to aggregation:
	rather than using quantitative methods to deal with the non-determinism of a learning
	system, we leverage the use of argumentation semantics to investigate the notion of
	properties holding consistently. Overall, we argue that the introduced formal dialogue
	framework opens many avenues both in the area of compliance checking and in the analysis
	of properties of opaque systems.},

The real problem is establishing the social and political will for assigning and maintaining accountability for artifacts when these artefacts are generated or used. In this chapter we review the necessity and tractability of maintaining human control, and the mechanisms by which this can be achieved. What makes the problem both most interesting and most threatening is that achieving consensus around such an approach requires at least some measure of agreement on broad existential concerns.},

	abstract = {Transparency is a key consideration for the ethical design and use of Artificial Intelligence, and has recently become a topic of considerable public interest and debate. We frequently use philosophical, mathematical, and biologically inspired techniques for building artificial, interactive, intelligent agents. Yet despite these well-motivated inspirations, the resulting intelligence is often developed as a black box, communicating no understanding of how the underlying real-time decision making functions. This compromises both the safety of such systems and fair attribution of moral responsibility and legal accountability when incidents occur. This dissertation provides the knowledge and software tools to make artificially intelligent agents more transparent, allowing a direct understanding of the action-selection system of such a system. The use of transparency, as demonstrated in this document, helps not only with the debugging of intelligent agents, but also with the public's understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by removing the 'scary' mystery around "why is it behaving like that". In the research described in this document I investigate and compare the perception we have of intelligent systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles, when they are treated as black boxes compared to when we make their action-selection systems transparent. Finally, I make normative and descriptive arguments for the moral status of intelligent systems and contribute to regulatory policy regarding such systems.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are being used to predict and assess behaviour in multiple domains, such as criminal justice and consumer finance, which directly affect human well-being. However, if AI is to improve people's lives, then people must be able to trust AI, which means being able to understand what the system is doing and why. Even though transparency is often seen as the requirement in this case, realistically it might not always be possible or desirable, whereas the need to ensure that the system operates within set moral bounds remains. In this paper, we present an approach to evaluate the moral bounds of an AI system based on the monitoring of its inputs and outputs. We place a "glass box" around the system by mapping moral values into explicit verifiable norms that constrain inputs and outputs, in such a way that if these remain within the box we can guarantee that the system adheres to the value. The focus on inputs and outputs allows for the verification and comparison of vastly different intelligent systems; from deep neural networks to agent-based systems. The explicit transformation of abstract moral values into concrete norms brings great benefits in terms of explainability; stakeholders know exactly how the system is interpreting and employing relevant abstract moral human values and calibrate their trust accordingly. Moreover, by operating at a higher level we can check the compliance of the system with different interpretations of the same value. These advantages will have an impact on the well-being of AI systems users at large, building their trust and providing them with concrete knowledge on how systems adhere to moral values.},

	abstract = {As robot reasoning becomes more complex, debugging becomes increasingly hard based solely on observable behaviour, even for robot designers and technical specialists. Similarly, non-specialist users find it hard to create useful mental models of robot reasoning solely from observed behaviour. The EPSRC Principles of Robotics mandate that our artefacts should be transparent, but what does this mean in practice, and how does transparency affect both trust and utility? We investigate this relationship in the literature and find it to be complex, particularly in non industrial environments where transparency may have a wider range of effects on trust and utility depending on the application and purpose of the robot. We outline our programme of research to support our assertion that it is nevertheless possible to create transparent agents that are emotion-ally engaging despite having a transparent machine nature.},

In this paper we review relevant robot systems architecture, design and transparency literature, and report on a programme of research to investigate practical approaches to improve robot transparency. We report on the investigation of real-time graphical and vocalised outputs as a means for both designers and end users to gain a better mental model of the internal state and decision making processes taking place within a robot. This approach, combined with a graphical approach to behaviour design, o ers improved transparency for robot designers. We also report on studies of users' understanding, where significant improvement has been achieved using both graphical and vocalisation transparency approaches.},
