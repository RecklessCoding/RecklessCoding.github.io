   abstract = {Several high profile incidents that involve Artificial Intelligence (AI) have captured public attention and increased demand for regulation. Low public trust and attitudes towards AI reinforce the need for concrete policy around its development and use. However, current guidelines and standards rolled out by institutions globally are considered by many as high-level and open to interpretation, making them difficult to put into practice. This paper presents ongoing research in the field of Responsible AI and explores numerous methods of operationalising AI ethics. If AI is to be effectively regulated, it must not be considered as a technology alone—AI is embedded in the fabric of our societies and should thus be treated as a socio-technical system, requiring multi-stakeholder involvement and employment of continuous value-based methods of assessment. When putting guidelines and standards into practice, context is of critical importance. The methods and frameworks presented in this paper emphasise this need and pave the way towards operational AI ethics. },

In the paper, we outline the development and structure of the draft standard. We present the rationale for transparency as a measurable, testable property. We outline five stakeholder groups: users, the general public and bystanders, safety certification agencies, incident/accident investigators and lawyers/expert witnesses, and explain the thinking behind the normative definitions of “levels” of transparency for each stakeholder group in P7001. The paper illustrates the application of P7001 through worked examples of both specification and assessment of fictional autonomous systems.},

    title = {Interrogating the Black Box: Transparency through Information-Seeking Dialogues},
    year = {2021},
    abstract = {This paper is preoccupied with the following question: given a (possibly opaque) learning
	system, how can we understand whether its behaviour adheres to governance constraints?
	The answer can be quite simple: we just need to "ask" the system about it. We propose
	to construct an investigator agent to query a learning agent-- the suspect agent--
	to investigate its adherence to a given ethical policy in the context of an information-seeking
	dialogue, modeled in formal argumentation settings. This formal dialogue framework
	is the main contribution of this paper. Through it, we break down compliance checking
	mechanisms into three modular components, each of which can be tailored to various
	needs in a vast amount of ways: an investigator agent, a suspect agent, and an acceptance
	protocol determining whether the responses of the suspect agent comply with the policy.
	This acceptance protocol presents a fundamentally different approach to aggregation:
	rather than using quantitative methods to deal with the non-determinism of a learning
	system, we leverage the use of argumentation semantics to investigate the notion of
	properties holding consistently. Overall, we argue that the introduced formal dialogue
	framework opens many avenues both in the area of compliance checking and in the analysis
	of properties of opaque systems.},
