I am a tenure-track associate professor in computer science at the <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en">Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña·BarcelonaTech (UPC)</a>. My research focuses on the techniques and tools needed for the design, implementation, and deployment of intelligent autonomous systems such as to ensure their trustworthiness. Over the past decade, I have been a PI and co-PI in projects related to eXplainable AI (XAI), assessment and auditing of AI systems, and interdisciplinary perspectives in AI.

At UPC, I am working towards developing the new <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en/masters/machine-learning-and-cybersecurity-for-internet-connected-systems">Master's degree in Machine Learning and Cybersecurity for Internet-Connected Systems</a>. In this role, I am developing a series of courses in fundamental AI, reactive planning, and AI governance. In parallel to my current post, I am an active member of AI Governance initiatives (e.g. IEEE SA’ P70xx series). 

Prior to joining UPC, I was one of the research leads in the <a href="https://www.umu.se/en/research/groups/responsible-artificial-intelligence/">Responsible AI group</a> run by <a href="https://people.cs.umu.se/virginia/">Priof. Virginia Dignum </a> at Umeå University and affiliated faculty to the <a href="http://wasp-sweden.org"> Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) </a>, where I also undertaken my postdoc. I completed my PhD at the University of Bath under the supervision of <a href="https://www.joannajbryson.org/">Prof. Joanna J. Bryson</a>.
